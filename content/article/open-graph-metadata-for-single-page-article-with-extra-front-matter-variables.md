This post tests Open Graph metadata added to article created as a single page with extra front matter variables such
as `publishDate`, `lastmod`, `images`, `audio`, and `videos`.

<!--more-->

The generated page source should contain base Open Graph metadata tags such as `og:site_name`, `og:title`
, `og:description`, `og:type`, `og:url`, `article:section`, `article:published_time`, `article:modified_time`
, `og:image`, `og:audio`, and `og:video`.
